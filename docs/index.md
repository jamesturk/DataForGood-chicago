Welcome to the DataForGood Chicago project! This document will provide you with an overview of our application, its key components, and the layout of our team's documentation.

### Application Overview:
Our web application aims to provide users with access to various socioeconomic data indicators for the City of Chicago. Users can explore and visualize data at different geographic levels, such as citywide, by zip code, by community area, or by census tract. The main objective of our web application is to help small and medium-sized nonprofits collect, analyze, and use Census data efficiently to achieve their goals. The application consists of three main sections: "About Us," "Data & Visualize," and "Resources."

###  Key Components:
The sections are made of three key components:
1. Data & Visualize: Select variables and indicators for analysis, generate interactive visualizations, and customizable dashboards for comprehensive insights.
2. Automated Insights and Memo Generation: Summarize key insights from data and visuals, generate ready-to-use memos or paragraphs.
3. Maps and City Resources: Explore and navigate city resources using integrated ArcGIS Online functionality.

### Documentation Layout
- `architecture.md`: details our projects' core concepts and architecture (data flow and backend, frontend and user interface, endpoints)
- `models.md`: documents our key database tables that our web application relies on 
- `endpoints/endpoints.md`: documents and identifies key URLs, their purpose, and parameters
- `changelog.md`: documentation of major changes for our team to reference
- `decisions` - directory with short write-ups of key technical decisions
