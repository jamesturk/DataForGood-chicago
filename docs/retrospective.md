## Keep
### Meetings:
- Weekly in-person check-ins twice a week
### Team Roles:
- Everyone taking ownership → we could efficiency tackle tasks
- Everyone’s flexibility in picking up tasks
- Liked having multiple people in the project roles (one lead and multiple supporting members for each the backend and frontend teams)
### Other:
- Commit messages were very clear and helped to establish where each team/person was at 
- Drive folder was helpful in allowing everyone to contribute in making the documentation and milestones
- Data consistency checks was helpful (Ruoyi added validation script in Jupyter notebook to match unique tract #’s between data) 
## Change
### Communication and Ticketing:
- Switch from iMessage  to Slack or WhatsApp as they would allow for more interaction
- Change the communication and visibility between backend and frontend teams and potentially have a progress report
- Have three meetings instead of two to gain more insight on updates throughout the week
- Easy to lose track of other areas outside of assigned roles (for example frontend roles may not be aware of what backend is doing) → should have had more consideration when picking roles
- Enforce code review guidelines and make sure that everyone is at least doing quick code reviews/skims
- Have our git repo connected to Slack Channel or have some type of Jinja board run through during our meetings
### Progress timeline:
- Plan the timeline better (there were a lot of blockers which made this hard) and adjust workload so that the work is distributed evenly across the nine weeks instead of all at the end
- Spent too much time in the early weeks discussing database design (which went out the window when actual data was put into the database); we should have created tickets for hard to scope/XL tasks and asked staff for a reasonable estimate of how long these tasks would take to complete
### Packages:
- Should have done more research on packages and their default settings (for example: jQuery brought in the Bootstrap package even though we didn’t want it) 
- Wanted to switch from Django to Flask and team members had previous experience with Flask
### Data:
- Should have done more research on the indicators as well as get the data more consistent earlier in the quarter
- Should have started with user experience and then built the app up from there (if time had permitted, it would’ve been useful to do user research/interviews)
## Want
### Team and Timeline:
- More people/more people working on one part
- More time: we could’ve done more in the first two weeks, but we didn’t start it until week 3
- Some sort of timeline or benchmark as to where our project should be compared to other teams (we didn’t know how behind we were until the new requirement meeting)
- More chances to switching roles 
## Up Next
- Dynamic year selection based on selected indicator
- Cleaner code
- More datasets from different sources
- More types of visualizations, like time series
- Interacting with multiple indicators at a time
- Loading sign after the user submits selected data
- More brainstorming sessions
